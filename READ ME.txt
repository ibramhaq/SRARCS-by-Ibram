About This Dataset:

This CSV file contains the environment data used for the SRARCS (Simple Reflex Agent Room Cleaning System) project.
Each number represents the state of a cell in a 5×5 room grid:

1 = Dirty cell (dirt present)

0 = Clean cell (no dirt)

Cleaned (%) = Shows how much of the room has been cleaned in each iteration

The dataset records multiple stages of the cleaning process - starting from a dirty environment and ending when the room becomes fully clean (100%).
It is a self-created dataset made specifically for demonstration and learning purposes in my Artificial Intelligence Lab project.
